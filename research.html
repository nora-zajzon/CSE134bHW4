                    <summary>Decoding Handwriting from EEG</summary>
                    <p>I am currently engaged in a research project at UC San Diego focused on detecting handwriting using EEG (electroencephalography). This project explores both physical handwriting and mental imagery of handwriting, leveraging machine learning classification models such as sLDA (sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis) to analyze neural activity patterns.

                        To enhance data visualization and accuracy, I integrate motion capture technology with EEG data, allowing for a dynamic representation of handwriting movements. This interdisciplinary approach provides insights into brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and their potential applications in assistive technologies, such as neural prosthetics for individuals with motor impairments.

                    <summary>EEG-Based Auditory Function Research</summary>
                    <p>Previously, I contributed to a research initiative at the Neural Engineering Research Lab at UCSD, where we studied human auditory function through EEG recordings. This project aimed to analyze alpha neurofeedback mechanisms, exploring how brainwave activity correlates with auditory perception.

                        Using a commercial EEG headset (CGX Systems) and custom in-ear EEG sensors developed in the Integrated Systems Neuroengineering Laboratory, we collected and analyzed brain activity in response to auditory stimuli. The research sought to establish a foundation for future in-ear EEG sensor development, potentially leading to non-invasive neurofeedback applications.</p>
